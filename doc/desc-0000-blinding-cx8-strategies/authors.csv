#
# While we wait for the LSST DESC publications system to generate files
# like this from its database, we'll need to edit authors.csv by hand.
# Below are some example entries.
#
# Notes:
#   - If someone has two affiliations, they get two rows, and the last row is
#     is used for their contribution.
#   - Cannot deal with empty rows...
#   - BUG: contributions are re-formatted into Title case, removing all other
#     capitalizations...

# Example rows for you to adapt:
