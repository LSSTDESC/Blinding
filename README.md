# DESC Blinding Modules
This repostory (under development) contains the blinding modules for blinding at the following levels of the analysis:
- Data-vector measurements
- Posterior distribution
- (TBC) Catalogues

Other info: the previous README can be found [here](bckp_README.md)

## Legacy Blinding
The [Legacy Blinding](legacy_blinding/) folder contains an updated version of Jessie Muir's scripts for blinding data-vectors using Cosmosis. The scripts have been adapted to work as a standalone module with Cosmosis V2 and [SACC](https://sacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [Under Construction!]. More information [here](legacy_blinding/README.md).
