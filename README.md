# DESC Blinding Modules
This repostory (under development) contains the blinding modules for blinding at the following levels of the analysis:
- Data-vector measurements
- Posterior distribution
- (TBC) Catalogues

Other info: the previous README can be found [here](bckp_README.md)

## Legacy Blinding
Legacy Blinding scripts for 2pt data vector blinding with Cosmosis moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/legacy_blinding).

The [Legacy Blinding](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/legacy_blinding) repositories contains an updated version of Jessie Muir's scripts for blinding data-vectors using Cosmosis. The scripts have been adapted to work as a standalone module with Cosmosis V2 and [SACC](https://sacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [Under Construction!].

> Under development. For questions contact @arthurmloureiro, @jessmuir, or @jablazek
