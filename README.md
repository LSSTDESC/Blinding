# Smokescreen: DESC Modules for data concealment (blinding)
This repostory (under development) contains the modules for data concealment (blinding) at the following levels of the analysis:
- Data-vector measurements
- Posterior distribution [not yet developed]
- (TBC) Catalogues


> :warning: Important notice :warning: : the term "blinding" is used in the context of data concealment for scientific analysis. We understand this is an outdated term and we are working to update it to a more appropriate term. If you have any suggestions, please let us know.

**You can find the documentation for Smokescreen [here](https://lsstdesc.org/Smokescreen/).**


## Legacy Blinding
Legacy Blinding scripts for 2pt data vector blinding with Cosmosis moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/legacy_blinding).

The [Legacy Blinding](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/legacy_blinding) repositories contains an updated version of Jessie Muir's scripts for blinding data-vectors using Cosmosis. The scripts have been adapted to work as a standalone module with Cosmosis V2 and [SACC](https://sacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [Under Construction!].

> Under development. For questions contact @arthurmloureiro, @jessmuir, or @jablazek
